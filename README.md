# BMI Calculator

This is a Flutter application designed to assist users in calculating their Body Mass Index (BMI) and presenting it visually. The application requests the user's input for height and weight, and subsequently calculates the BMI using the formula (weight / (height * height)). The user can conveniently observe their BMI value alongside a graphical representation denoting the corresponding BMI range, including classifications such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. Additionally, the application offers a concise explanation of BMI and its calculation methodology.
